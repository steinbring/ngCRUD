ngCRUD: An AngularJS-based CRUD Boilerplate
======

*What?*

This is meant to be a highly reusable, efficient CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) example application.  The core functionality is written in JavaScript, using AngularJS.  My goal was to only use server-side technologies for interaction with the database.

There is currently one version of the updater (a sortable, searchable, pagable grid with 'new', 'edit', 'delete' buttons).  My intention is to add more versions over time.  There is definitely more than one way to write a CRUD app.

*Why?*

I have been trying to get good at AngularJS for a while now.  While I was at my 9 to 5 job, I have very little opportunity to leverage it.  This is a good excuse to use it.

*Acknoledgments*

I leveraged a few projects in this:
